# project-blackjack

This is a work-in-progess/learning project that plays with classes to create an automated blackjack simulator. It reads a strategy file to determine player action. The strategy file is based on a version of the "optimal blackjack strategy" grid that's available in many places. It will have a graphic representation of the simulation.
