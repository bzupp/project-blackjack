# project-blackjack

This is a learning project that plays with classes to create this automated blackjack program or simulator. It reads a strategy strategy file used to determine player action. The strategy file is based on a version of the "optimal blackjack strategy" grid that's available in many places. It will have a graphic representation of the simulation.
